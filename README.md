# Spiders-in-Space-
Hello reader! this is my first game made in Gamemaker studio ,this was done by following the Youtube series of Tom Francis,i also used various assets by kenney land.

**Game Info**
<p>There are currently two modes</o>
1.Unlimited mode
Kill the spider eggs which will  spawn spiders in the room,each kill gets you points, remember to dodge the spiders.

2.Capture the gem
capture the gem which gets randomly spawned also you have to dodge the enemies and there is no way to shoot them.
After capturing the gem,the number of enemies will increase.

**Controls**
W,A,S,D to move
R to restart
ESC to exit game

**known issues and bugs**
1.There are currently no player boundries set,so try not to go outside of a frame ,if you do you can locate yourself by shooting a trail of bullets and then use movement keys to come back onscreen again.
2.in Capture the gem mode there is no way to get rid of enemeis and game will keep adding enemies,i will ork on a clear screen or a shrink enemies feature.
3.the game scores and lives count and the control buttons will go out of view when you move through the view ,i am working on this so that they stay at the top of the screen constantly,(Its probably easy to fix but since im new to gamemaker i dont know even the simplest things)
